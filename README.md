Some additional points :
 1. It loads continously as you scroll.
 2. You can modify Movie details page to add some more details
 3. Main heading on landing page is not capitalized ðŸ˜‚ you can modify that
 4. if you open it on desktop (browser) you will be defaultly redirected to "/movies" route, because "/" have nothing on it ðŸ˜‚.
 5. Follow me on github if you like it and give star to this repo.
 6. Keep smilling...!!!
